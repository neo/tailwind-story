      <p>Hey, my name is Wenchen Li, and I also go by Neo.</p>
      <p>
        I currently work at a production agency (<a

        where I make our creative team's imagination come true. I build web
        experiences with perfect UI and fancy animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I compose with React and CSS on a daily basis, and work with TypeScript
        and Angular from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pay a lot of attention to details and couldn't sleep at night if I
        didn't get them perfect. Same when even the tiniest thing doesn't seem
        right, I would always try to get to the bottom and root of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe having equally impressive, clean and elegant code behind is
        just as important as having the visually impressive, clean and elegant
        site. So our team invest a lot in thinking, discussing, designing and
        improving our internal tools as well as trying to maintain a relatively
        high code quality.

      <a href="#i-need-to-take-part"><h2>Why I want to be part of this</h2></a>
      <p>
        This is built with Tailwind CSS, and it's actually my first time using
        it. However, <em>CSS</em> and <em>toolings for developers</em> are the
        two things I'm always obsessed with and enjoy building everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love open source and interacting with the community. Even the smallest
        contribution gives me a lot of satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the countless delightful experiences I made, I wouldn't be able
        to achieve a elegant website myself without a designer. I know what's
        nice looking but I just couldn't come up with it on my own, and I'm sure
        I'm not alone. That's where I think Tailwind CSS could come in and help.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy building tools that are targeted to be consumed by developers
        because we speak the same language and it's much easier to communicate.
        And just imagine the satisfaction of knowing there'd be so many fellow
        developers out there who are happily using the thing I help build and
        maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, developers would know to appreciate all the thinking, designing
        and architect effort we put behind something, which is a kind of
        satisfaction normal users can't give.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, I love CSS, more than people normally do. And I
        think people underestimate it a lot and not give it enough credit. But I
        always try to achieve things with CSS first and then be so proud of
        myself after showing people what I was able to achieve with just CSS.

        This is just a brain dump of some of the things I want to share; I wish
        I had more time to write down everything I have in mind and in a nicer
        way.
